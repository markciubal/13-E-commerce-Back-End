## Description
The E-Commerce Back End project was an attempt at creating APIs to interact with a database via GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes. By creating these routes we allow users to make changes via Insomnia, and will eventually be able to create frontend JavaScript to pass information from a form into these API routes.

This application was meant to satisfy the following user story:


## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
✅ THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
✅ THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
✅ THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
✅ THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
✅ THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
